## East Metro Pulse Interactive Data Book

This project is an interactive data book for East Metro Pulse Volume 2 survey data.
Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General requirements

* The Data Book will initially display a list of available Result Types and Question search/select options
* Users will be prompted to select at least one Result Type and at least one Question
* Selecting at least one of each will begin to display the relevant Data Tables

## Additional considerations

* Users may change their selections at any time, and the Data Book should update as they do so.
* Users will get links to download all or individual Data Tables in .CSV format.

## Currently out of scope

* Users will not be able to save, bookmark, or share links to the selections theyâ€™ve made.

## East Metro Pulse Interactive Data Book

This project is a proof-of-concept for an interactive data book of East Metro Pulse survey data.
Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General requirements

* When initially loaded, the Data Book will display a list or a selection menu of Topics
* As a user begins selecting Topics, a selection list of the related Questions will appear
* Selecting Questions will trigger display of the available Result Types for those Questions
* Selecting Result Types will then begin to display the Data Tables

## Additional considerations

* Users may change their selections at any time, and the Data Book should update as they do so.
* Users will get one or more links to download their selected Data Tables in .CSV format.

## Currently out of scope

* Users will not be able to save, bookmark, or share links to the selections theyâ€™ve made.

## Interactive demo

Test out a [mockup of this wireframe](https://test.wilderresearch.org/projects/emp-databook/mockup.php). (Note: This works best in Chrome right now.)
